M0 Core
=======

This is based off the T-head e907 design `(datasheet)
<https://www.t-head.cn/product/e907?lang=en>`__

The core is implemented as RV32IMAFCP with the instruction (32k)
and data (16k) cache enabled.  The interrupt controller
is implemented with the CLIC interrupt standard.

Implemented standards:
 * The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume I: RISC-V User-Level ISA, Version 2.2
 * The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume II: RISC-V Privileged Architecture, Version 1.10
 * RISC-V Core-Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC) Version 0.8
 * RISC-V External Debug Support Version 0.13.2
 * RISC-V "P" Extension Proposal Version 0.9
