=======
D0 Core
=======

This is based off the T-head c906 design `(datasheet)
<https://www.t-head.cn/product/c906?lang=en>`__

The core is implemented as RV64IMAFCV with level-1 cache (32KB cache line 64B). 
The interrupt controller supports both CLINT and PLIC.

Vector Support:
 * Compatible with RISC-V V vector extension standard (revision 0.7.1)
 * Supports vector execution unit (128 bits)
 * Supports INT8/INT16/INT32/FP16/FP32 vector operations
 * Supports segment load and store instructions

Because this support was implemented using the 0.7 vector specification
many compilers do not support this at least for auto-vectorization. T-head
provides a version of gcc with some support for this preliminary specification.

Implemented standards:
 * The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume I: RISC-V User-Level ISA, Version 2.2
 * The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume II: RISC-V Privileged Architecture, Version 1.10
 * RISC-V "V" Vector Extension, Version 0.7.1-20190610-Workshop-Release.
 * RISC-V External Debug Support Version 0.13.2
